# Red-Team-Operation-Project
This red team operation successfully simulated a targeted cyberattack against the Morning Catch environment. 
The engagement highlighted critical security gaps, including unpatched legacy systems, weak credential practices, and lack of network segmentation.
The operation began with passive and active reconnaissance, where we identified exposed services and extracted valid usernames via SMTP enumeration. 
Using this information, a reverse shell payload was crafted with msfvenom and disguised as a legitimate system update. The payload was delivered through a phishing email composed and sent via a vulnerable SMTP service, exploiting social engineering techniques to lure the CEO into executing the malicious file.
Upon execution, the payload established a reverse shell to the attacker’s machine, enabling full control of the target. Persistence was achieved using a scheduled task that ensured recurring execution of the payload. 
Command and control were maintained via RDP using valid credentials, followed by privilege escalation to root access. This allowed for full administrative control and set the stage for lateral movement toward a second target within the defined test scope.
The engagement successfully demonstrated how a motivated attacker could chain together multiple attack vectors—information gathering, phishing, payload execution, persistence. These findings underscore the need for improved system hardening, user awareness training, and proactive detection capabilities.
